				<b>Revised August 11, 2011</b><br/><br/>
				The General Recreational Activity Feed Specification defines a common format for identifying water resources and their associated schedules.  This document explains the specification in detail and is a work in progress.  We value any feedback you might have to improve the specification and do not gaurantee that things won't change without notice.

			<h2 class="title" id="status">Document Status</h2>
			<p class="text">
				This is the first formalization of the specification that was drafted at August 3rd's OpenHamilton meetup.  We are working to extend the minimal specification currently defined based on ideas first presented in the <a href="http://code.google.com/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.html">General Transit Feed Specification</a>.  If you would like to work on the specification you can join the <a href="groups.google.com/group/openhamilton">mailing list</a>.

			<h2 class="title" id="terms">Common Terms</h2>
			<p class="text">
				This section defines some terms that will be used throughout the document.
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Field required</b> - This is a required value and the column must be present.  Some fields may allow an empty/null value such as an empty string or 0.  An empty string is represented as leaving no space in between the two commas for the field.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Field optional</b> - This column may be omitted from your feed but if included requires that each record have a value assigned in the field.  Some fields may allow an empty/null value such as an empty string or 0.  An empty string is represented as leaving no space in between the two commas for the field.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<a href="#top" class="back">Back to Top</a>

			<h2 class="title" id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
			<p class="text">
				This specification defines the following files:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b><a href="#facilities_txt">facilities.txt</a></b> - <b>Required</b>.  This file contains information regarding the facilities an organization makes available to the public.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b><a href="#resources_txt">resources.txt</a></b> - <b>Required</b>.  This file contains information regarding the various water resources available at a given facility.  Examples of resources would be pools, splash pads and beaches.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b><a href="#activities_txt">activites.txt</a></b> - <b>Required</b>.  This file contains information regarding any activities that are offered at a particular resource.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b><a href="#activity_times_txt">activity_times.txt</a></b> - <b>Required</b>.  This file contains scheduling information for the various activities that are offered at a particular resource.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b><a href="#activity_exceptions_txt">activity_exceptions.txt</a></b> - <b>Optional</b>.  This file contains any service exceptions that may arise due to inconsistents events (holidays, etc) affecting an activity's availability.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b><a href="#fees_txt">fees.txt</a></b> - <b>Required</b>.  This file contains the single use fee structures associated with your agency's activities.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b><a href="#fee_classes_txt">fee_classes.txt</a></b> - <b>Required</b>.  This file contains composition of fees in order to ease querying.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h2 class="inline">File Requirements</h2>
			<p class="text">
				The following requirements apply to the format and contents of your files:
				<ul>
					<li>All files in a Water Specification Format must be saved as comma-delimited text.</li>
					<li>The first line of each file must contain field names. Each subsection of the <a href="#definitions">Field Definitions</a> section corresponds to one of the files in a transit feed and lists the field names you may use in that file.</li>
					<li>All field names are case-sensitive.</li>
					<li>Field values may not contain tabs, carriage returns or new lines.</li>
					<li>
						Field values that contain quotation marks or commas must be enclosed within quotation marks. In addition, each quotation mark in the field value must be preceded with a quotation mark. This is consistent with the manner in which Microsoft Excel outputs comma-delimited (CSV) files. For more information on the CSV file format, see <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180</a>.<br/>
						The following example demonstrates how a field value would appear in a comma-delimited file:</br>
						<ul class="sub">
							<li><b>Original field value:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>Contains "quotes", commas and text</pre></li>
							<li><b>Field value in CSV file:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>"Contains ""quotes"", commas and text"</pre></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Field values must not contain HTML tags, comments or escape sequences.</li>
					<li>Remove any extra spaces between fields or field names. Many parsers consider the spaces to be part of the value, which may cause errors.</li>
					<li>Each line must end with a CRLF or LF linebreak character.</li>
					<li>Files should be encoded in UTF-8 to support all Unicode characters. Files that include the Unicode byte-order mark (BOM) character are acceptable. Please see the Unicode FAQ for more information on the BOM character and UTF-8.</li>
					<li>
						Name your feed files using the following naming conventions:
						<ul class="sub">
							<li>facilities.txt</li>
							<li>resources.txt</li>
							<li>activities.txt</li>
							<li>activity_times.txt</li>
							<li>activity_exceptions.txt</li>
							<li>fees.txt</li>
							<li>fee_classes.txt</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Zip the files in your feed.</li>
				</ul>
