Dowsing Desktop Widget
----------------------
This is the desktop version of OpenHamilton's Dowsing app.  You can embed it into any site you want.

How To Use
----------
Simple paste the following script into your website where you want the widget to appear:

    <script type="text/javascript">
      var DowsingConfig = { height: 500, width: 500 };
      document.write(unescape("%3Cscript src='http://openhamilton.ca/dowsing/desktop/dowsing.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E"));

    </script>

You can configure the height and width by changing their values in DowsingConfig.  Please note the minimum height is 400px and the minimum width is 500px.
